# UW SEDS Refactoring Starter Code

Made for educational purposes for the students of [UW-SEDS (CSE 583)](https://uwseds.github.io)

## Purpose

As a new developer, it can be useful to work through existing code with someone who has more experience and can point out issues as you go; this helps hone your ability to filter through large codebases. Hopefully, working through this self-contained, smaller-scale problem with someone more experienced will be useful as you continue developing software!

Other than converting the original [Python 2 code from caradojo/trivia](https://github.com/caradojo/trivia/blob/master/python/trivia.py) to [Python 3](./main.py) using [2to3](https://docs.python.org/3.12/library/2to3.html), I have no prior experience with this codebase and have not examined it before.

**Note:** The final solution will be in the `refactoring` branch

## Recommendations for further refactoring:

1. add more types

2. remove all magic numbers

3. extend the code to work dynamically for various categories (passed in as a list of strings during game initialization)

4. add logging

5. add tests! (if you're a CSE 583 student this should be your first step!)
